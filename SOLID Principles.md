## iOS Developers Interview SOLID Principles Questions

### 1. SOLID Principles in Swift

 - `Single Responsibility Principle`
    - There should never be more than one reason for a class to be change.
```swift
```

 - `Open-Closed Principle`
    - Software entities (Class. Modules, Functions etc) should open for extension but close for modification. 
```swift
```

 - `Liskov Substitution Principle`
    - Function that use references to base class must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it.

```swift
```

 - `Interface Segregation Principle`
    - Client should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use.

```swift
```

 - `Dependency Inversion Principle`
    - High level modules should not depend upon low level modules. Both should depend upon abstractions.
    - Abstractions should not depend upon details. Details should depend upon abstractions.

```swift
```
