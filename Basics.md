### 1. Interview Questions for iOS Developers1. What’s the difference between var and let? Which one would you choose for properties in a struct and why?
   Ans - -> var is used to declare variables whose values can change after they are initially set. You can reassign a new value to a var property.
         -> let is used to declare constants whose values cannot change once they are assigned. Once a value is set for a let property, it cannot be 
             modified.
